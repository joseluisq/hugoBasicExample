# Comments

Hugo ships with an internal Disqus template, but this isn’t the only commenting system that will work with your new Hugo website.

Hugo ships with support for [Disqus](https://disqus.com/), a third-party service that provides comment and community capabilities to websites via JavaScript.

Your theme may already support Disqus, but if not, it is easy to add to your templates via [Hugo’s built-in Disqus partial](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/#disqus).
